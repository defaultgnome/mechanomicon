Battle - a mathematical comparison between two members of a set. Obviously all members can be compared with each other (tie is a comparison) else you have invalid state, which mean they are not in the sane set. 

Cyclical Battle Game - a battle game where all members point in/directly to themself. (Wip) rock paper scissors. 

Pyramidal Battle Game - a tree, must be one headed, else it mean it can not be compared. Tango cards value. (Maybe useless)

Ladder Battle Game - a line. Dice.
