 A **Variant** is a modified form of a base game element (the **Reference**) that retains structural and functional similarity while differing in one or more defined aspects.
> Formally, if **A** is a Variant of **B**, then:  
>  - **A ≠ B**
>  - **A ∈ F(B)**, where _F(B)_ is the set of elements structurally derived from **B**
>  - and **Δ(A, B)** ≠ ∅, where _Δ_ is the difference function

A Variant must be recognizably derived from its Reference. The difference(s) should be identifiable and expressible.

> **Usage:** “A is a Variant of B, where \[difference\].”

**Examples:**
- _Street Fighter_ – Ryu and Evil Ryu: Evil Ryu is a Variant of Ryu with altered stats and moves.
- _Chess_ – Chess960 is a Variant of classical chess with randomized back-rank pieces.

### **Rare Variant**
A **Rare Variant** is a Variant that appears with low statistical probability (see [[Statistics]]) in the context of normal gameplay.  

> **Usage:** “X is a Rare Variant of Y, with a drop/spawn/appearance chance of Z%.”

**Examples:**
- _Terraria_ – The Pink Slime is a Rare Variant of the regular Slime.
- _Pokémon_ – Shiny Pokémon are Rare Variants with altered color palettes and identical base stats.
- _Factorio_ – Quality items (e.g. Legendary) are Rare Variants of normal items with better stats (making it a Buffed Rare Variant).

### **Buffed Variant**
 A **Buffed Variant** is a Variant that exhibits strictly improved numeric attributes (e.g., damage, health, speed) but does not alter the core mechanics or behavior.  

**Examples:**
- _MapleStory_ – Blue Slime is a Buffed Variant of Green Slime with more HP.
- _Minecraft_ – Diamond Sword is a Buffed Variant of Iron Sword (same mechanics, higher damage/durability).
- _Terraria_ – Weapon tiers like Copper → Iron → Silver, etc.

### **Boss Variant**
 A **Boss Variant** is a **Buffed Variant** with additional complexity, usually including expanded move-sets, scripted behavior, or unique mechanics. 
Boss Variants often appear in isolated or cinematic contexts (e.g., arena fights, 1v1s).  

**Examples:**
- _Elden Ring_ – Beastman of Farum Azula is a Boss Variant of lesser Beastmen.
- _Terraria_ – King Slime is a Boss Variant of the common Slime.
- _Clair Obscur_ – [Insert example if known].
